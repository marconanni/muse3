/**
 * Informs the RTP listener that a certain SSRC has not sent packets
 * in a long  while and can be considered timed-out.  This call has
 * the exact  same semantics as the 'bye()'  callback, in that the
 * SSRC may  refer to a participant as a whole or just one of
 * several  of a participant's ReceiveStreams.  In other words,
 * RTPSM treats an SSRC timing  out the same as it treats a BYE from
 * that SSRC.   See the documentation for bye() (below)  for more
 * information. <p>
 *
 * For obvious reasons, there is no 'reason' string to hand back to
 * the  listener. <P>
 * The timeout event is sent in case of RTP/RTCP packets not being
 * received from active senders as well as passive receivers. In case
 * of passive receivers, the ReceiveStream parameter is null.
 * Currently, the timeout is set to 30 mins
