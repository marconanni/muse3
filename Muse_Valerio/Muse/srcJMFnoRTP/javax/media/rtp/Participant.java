/**
 * This interface represents one participant in an RTP session.
 * Within a session,  a participant is defined to be the application
 * sending and  receiving data on that session.  Note  that this doesn't
 * necessarily  imply that participants are human. A single participant
 * may be the source of zero or more streams of RTP data packets, each
 * of which is represented by an RTPStream  object obtainable via the
 * getStreams().<P>
 *
 * RTPSM only creates instances of the two subclasses of this class,
 * RTPRemoteParticipant and RTPLocalParticipant.  Of all the
 * Participants  objects managed by the  RTPSessionManager, only one
 * is the local participant and thus an instance of
 * RTPLocalParticipant. <P>
 *
 * All the other Participants in the session (obtainable via
 * RTPSM.getRemoteParticipants()) are "remote" and are instances of
 * RTPRemoteParticipant; calls to getStreams() on  remote participants
 * return a Vector of ReceiveStream objects.  The client can determine
 * whether  an Participant is local doing a simple "instanceof" test. <P>
 *
 * Participants are identified by the CNAME string, which is
 * transmitted in every  RTCP packet.Since a participant may begin
 * sending data packets *before* the CNAME of the  participant has
 * arrived in an RTCP packet, it is possible that a data stream will
 * exist, for a  short time, as "unassociated" with any participant.
 * See ReceiveStream for more details.  <P>
 *
 * Note that this abstraction defines a participant *within* a
 * session; in real  life, "participants"
 * can be involved in more than one RTP session at a time. <P>

     * method  will return an empty Vector. Note that if this call is
     * made  after  data has started coming in from a new SSRC from this
     * participant, but before an RTCP packet  has arrived to map that
     * SSRC to this  participant, that receive stream will not turn up
     * in this call; when and if said RTCP packet arrives and the orphan
