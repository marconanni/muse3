/**
 * A programmer may abstract the underlying transport mechanism for
 * RTP control and data from the RTPSM. This is done via the RTPSocket
 * object. A RTPSocket datasource must be created and handed over to
 * Manager. The Manager will take care of creating a player for the content
 * type defined for this datasource. When hiding the underlying
 * transport protocol from the RTPSessionManager, the user is
 * responsible for streaming control and data to and from this
 * RTPSocket. 
 * Basically, every RTPSocket is a JMF compliant datasource and is used
 * for streaming the data channel of an RTP session to the RTPSM. 
 * Specifically, the RTPSocket is an instance of an RTPPushDataSource. It
 * also has a control counterpart RTPPushDataSource which is accessed via 
 * methods of the DataChannel interface. Connecting, disconnecting,
 * starting and stopping the RTPSocket will take care of calling these
 * methods on the control RTPPushDataSource as well.The programmer will
 * still need to set the source and destination streams for
 * the data and control source.
 *
 * @deprecated This inferface has been replaced with the RTPConnector interface.
