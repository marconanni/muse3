 * @(#)BufferControl.java	1.5 02/08/21
 *
 * The BufferControl is used to exercise user level control over the
 * buffering done by a particular object. The object exporting this control
 * is responsible for buffering data, and users may change the length of
 * the buffer and the minimum threshold of the buffer based on their needs.
 * By default, the buffer length and minimum threshold will be set to certain
 * default values.  These default values can be retrieved and changed by the
 * user if desired. 
 * A buffer length is always set by this object. A minimum threshold for 
 * jitter buffering may or may not be set depending on the format. .e.g. 
 * in case of audio, a non-zero minimum threshold will be set (jitter 
 * buffering will be done), while in case of video, a zero minimum threshold
 * will be set (no jitter buffering will be done).
 * Each buffer control should have its own default and maximum buffer
 * lengths, which are set using MAX_VALUE and DEFAULT_VALUE.
