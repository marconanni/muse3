/**
 * The <code>FramePositioningControl</code> is the interface to control 
 * precise positioning to a video frame for <code>Players</code> 
 * and <code>Processors</code>.
 * <p>
 * Frame numbers for a bounded movie should generally begin with 0,
 * corresponding to media time 0.  Each video frame of a movie
 * should have a unique frame number that is one bigger than the
 * previous frame. 
 * <p>
 * There is a direct mapping between the frame number and the media
 * time of a video frame; although not all <code>Players</code> can
 * compute that relationship.  For <code>Players</code> that can
 * compute that relationship, the <code>mapFrameToTime</code> and
 * <code>mapTimeToFrame</code> methods can be used.
 * <p>
 * When a <code>Player</code> is seeked or skipped to a new video frame, 
 * the media time of the <code>Player</code> will be changed to the 
 * media time of the corresponding video frame.  A 
 * <code>MediaTimeSetEvent</code> will be sent.
 * @since JMF 2.0
