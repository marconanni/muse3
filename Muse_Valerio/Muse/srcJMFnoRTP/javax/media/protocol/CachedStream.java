/**
 * This interface is implemented by a <code>SourceStream</code> that caches
 * downloaded data for fast delivery to the handler. It provides control
 * over enabling/disabling the buffering and provides a way to query if
 * a certain number of bytes are available to be read from the stream.
 * <P>
 * Buffering here refers to jitter-buffering. Buffering is normally enabled.
 * It enables smooth playback even if the incoming data rate fluctuates.
 * The amount of buffering is implementation dependant.
 * <P>
 * When parsing the header of a media file, the parser
 * may want to read a few bytes to check for say a valid
 * magic header; if the magic header is illegal, the
 * parser can throw a BadHeaderException. The parser
 * may build several tables and extract media track
 * information.
 * <P>
 * The parser typically doen't need to wait for the buffers to be
 * filled. 
 * So it is desirable to turn off buffering when parsing the
 * header and turn it on after the header is read.
 * This won't have any effect on playback smoothness
 * since playback cannot start until the header is parsed.
