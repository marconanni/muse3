/**
 * Abstracts a single stream of media data.
 *
 * <h2>Stream Controls</h2>
 *
 * A <code>SourceStream</code> might support an operation that
 * is not part of the <code>SourceStream</code> definition.
 * For example a stream might support seeking to a particular byte
 * in the stream.  In that case, it should implement the 
 * <code>Seekable</code> interface.  Some streams allow its output 
 * format to be changed.  It should then implement the
 * <code>Formattable</code> interface.
 * <p>
 * Many operations are dependent on the stream
 * data, and support cannot be determined until the stream is in
 * use.
 * <p>
 *
 * To obtain all of the objects that provide control over a stream
 * use <code>getControls</code>. To determine if a particular
 * kind of control is available, and obtain the object that
 * implements the control use <code>getControl</code>.
