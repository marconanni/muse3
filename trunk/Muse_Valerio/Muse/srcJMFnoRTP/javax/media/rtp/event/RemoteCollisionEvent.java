 * usually  precede two newReceiveStream() callbacks; these new
 * ReceiveStreams   will (eventually) be associated with the existing
 * Participants. The old  ReceiveStreams  associated with those
 * participants will be discarded and no longer returned by their
 * respective  getStreams() methods.
