/**
 * Informs the SessionListener that data & control packets have stopped
 * arriving on this ReceiveStream. The time for which the RTPSM waits
 * for data & control packets before notifying the listeners of this event is
 * approximately equal to the RTCP report interval as specified in the
 * RTP draft. 
 * InactiveRecvStreamEvent will also be generated to say the passive
 * receivers that have timed out. The timeout used for this is the 5 times
 * the report interval as per the draft and is measured for RTCP
 * packets for RTCP packets from this passive receiver. In the case of
 * a passive receiver, the ReceiveStream will be null.
 * If data or control is resumed from this member, an
 * ActiveRecvStreamEvent will be generated. 
 * In case of the RTP draft, a member is to be timed out if an RTP/RTCP
 * packet is not received in the timeout time. In our implementation, the
 * InactiveRecvStreamEvent is sent, but the member is not removed from
 * our cache until a much larger timeout (set to 30 min).At this time,
 * a TimeOutEvent is sent to the ReceiveStreamListener.This is done in
 * order to take care of inactivity due to network partitions.
