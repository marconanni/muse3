/**
 * The interface implemented by the RTPManager. This is the
 * starting point for creating, maintaining and closing an RTP
 * session.
 * <p>
 * <b>1. Unicast Session</b>
 * <br>
 * The following code fragment illustrates how to create a unicast
 * session:
 * <pre>
 * import java.net.*;
 * import javax.media.rtp.*;
 *
 * // create the RTP Manager
 * RTPManager rtpManager = RTPManager.newInstance();
 * 
 * // create the local endpoint for the local interface on
 * // any local port
 * SessionAddress localAddress = new SessionAddress();
 * 
 * // initialize the RTPManager
 * rtpManager.initialize( localAddress);
 *
 * // add the ReceiveStreamListener if you need to receive data
 * // and do other application specific stuff
 * // ...
 * 
 * // specify the remote endpoint of this unicast session 
 * // the address string and port numbers in the following lines
 * // need to be replaced with your values.
 * InetAddress ipAddress = InetAddress.getByName( "168.1.2.3");
 * 
 * SessionAddress remoteAddress = new SessionAddress( ipAddress, 3000);
 *
 * // open the connection
 * rtpManager.addTarget( remoteAddress);
 * 
 * // create a send stream for the output data source of a processor
 * // and start it
 * DataSource dataOutput = createDataSource();
 *
 * SendStream sendStream = rtpSession.createSendStream( dataOutput, 1);
 * sendStream.start();
 * 
 * // send data and do other application specific stuff,
 * // ...
 * 
 * // close the connection if no longer needed.
 * rtpManager.removeTarget( remoteAddress, "client disconnected.");
 * 
 * // call dispose at the end of the life-cycle of this RTPManager so
 * // it is prepared to be garbage-collected.
 * rtpManager.dispose();
 * </pre> 
 * <b>2. Multi-Unicast Session</b>
 * <br>
 * Creating multi-unicast sessions is similar to the example above. After
 * creating and starting the SendStream new remote endpoints may be added
 * by subsequent addTarget calls:
 * <pre>
 *   addTarget( remoteAddress2);
 *   addTarget( remoteAddress3);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>3. Multicast Session</b>
 * <br>
 * Creating and participating in multicast sessions also works similar
 * to the unicast example. Instead of specifying local and remote endpoints
 * a multicast session address needs to be created and passed into the
 * initialize and addTarget calls. Everything else follows the unicast
 * example.
 * <pre>
 * //...
 *
 * // create a multicast address for 224.1.1.0 and ports 3000/3001
 * IPAddress ipAddress = InetAddress.getByName( "224.1.1.0");
 * 
 * SessionAddress multiAddress = new SessionAddress( ipAddress, 3000);
 * 
 * // initialize the RTPManager
 * rtpManager.initialize( multiAddress);
 * 
 * // add the target
 * rtpManager.addTarget( multiAddress);
 * 
 * // ...
